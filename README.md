# Block-Display-Builder
## WARNING:
- Use it at your own risk, this datapack create entities which means that the more you create the more lag you add to your world or server.
- I recomend creating a backup of your minecraft world before using it.
## Credit:
This datapack uses the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Triton365/BlockState">blockstate</a> datapack by Triton365
## How to install it:
1. Navigate your world folder which is located by default in `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\<your_world_folder>` in windows.
2. In your **wold folder** go to `datapacks` and put the datapack you downloaded it their.
## How to use:
### Getting the menu:
Their is two ways to get it:
1. Using the command `/reload` to get the book which allows you to access the menu on right clicking. (the book was added in version 3.3 and above (older versions will just show the menu))
2. Using the command `/function bdb:show_menu` which will show the menu directly.
### Settings:
In settings you have:
- Collision: to make the block display solid (can step on it and interact with it)
- Translation: this will simply spawn all the block display in one place and translate their display to their correct location.
- Speed: control the speed of creating the block display (the more speed you add the more pressure you give to your computer or the server (effect the server side of the game))
## Features:
- User friendly menu.
- Simple display to show the selected area.
- Customizable settings.
- Works on unloaded chunks.
- Saves the hotbar before starting using the datapack (added in version 3.3+)
